#+TITLE: Bruce Ravel's CV

* Files:

  + ~cv.tex~: the LaTeX source for my CV
  + ~highlights.bib~: bib file with my favorite citations
  + ~allmine.bib~: bib file with all the rest of my citations
  + ~BR_smiling.jpg~: my photo
  + ~moderncv.purple.patch~: a patch to the Modern CV LaTeX class to add a color of my choice

* Required downloads:

  + The Modern CV class: [[https://launchpad.net/moderncv]] 
     - Unpack the zip file into the current directory (or, I suppose,
       install it system-wide).  Really only need the ~.sty~ and
       ~.cls~ files in the current directory.
     - Apply the patch: ~patch < moderncv.purple.patch~ to add the purple color theme
  + etoolbox: [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/etoolbox]]
     - Again, only need the ~etoolbox.sty~ file in the current directory.
