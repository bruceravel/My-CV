#+TITLE: Bruce Ravel's CV

[[http://xafs.org/BruceRavel?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Ravel_cv.pdf][A PDF copy of my CV]]

* Files:

  + ~cv.tex~: the LaTeX source for my CV
  + ~highlights.bib~: bib file with my favorite citations
  + ~allmine.bib~: bib file with all the rest of my citations
  + ~BR_smiling.jpg~: my photo
  + ~moderncv.purple.patch~: a patch to the Modern CV LaTeX class to add a color of my choice

* Required downloads:

  + The Modern CV class: [[https://launchpad.net/moderncv]] 
     - Unpack the zip file into the current directory (or, I suppose,
       install it system-wide).  Really only need the ~.sty~ and
       ~.cls~ files in the current directory.
     - +Apply the patch: ~patch < moderncv.purple.patch~ to add the purple color theme+ 
       My purple theme has been included since version 0.13, so the patch is no longer necessary.
  + etoolbox: [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/etoolbox]]
     - Again, only need the ~etoolbox.sty~ file in the current directory.
  + I had to install Ubuntu's ~texlive-latex-extra~ to get one of
    Modern CV's dependencies (~xargs.sty~)
