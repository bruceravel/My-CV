#+TITLE: Bruce Ravel's CV

* Files:

  + ~cv.tex~: the LaTeX source for my CV
  + ~allmine.bib~: bib file with all my citations
  + ~BR_smiling.jpg~: my photo

* Using these LaTeX addons

  These are not my own work, but they are not standard parts of a
  LaTeX installation, so I have included them in this repo.

  + The Modern CV class: [[https://launchpad.net/moderncv]] This includes
    the tweaklist.sty file.  Both theme files have been hacked at to
    include a purple theme.
  + etoolbox: [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/etoolbox]]
