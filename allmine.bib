  ABSTRACT = {Bimetallic phosphorus oxides have emerged as attractive candidates for use as cathode materials in the next generation of lithium-based batteries owing to the operation of multielectron transfer processes and thermochemical stabilities conferred by the incorporation of phosphate groups. In particular silver vanadium phosphorus oxide, Ag(2)VO(2)PO(4), shows a much desired in situ conductivity enhancement upon discharge resulting in inherently high power capability with minimal conductive additives needed. However, the amorphization of Ag(2)VO(2)PO(4) during electrochemical discharge precludes the use of standard diffraction tools to monitor changes in the local electronic and geometric structure. Here, we have utilized a combination of V K-, V L-, Ag K-, and O K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to determine the local vanadium and silver oxidation states, local coordination geometry, and Stoichiometry for Ag(2)VO(2)PO(4) samples with varying extents of electrochemical lithiation. Soft X-ray V L- and O K-edge measurements provide a detailed orbital-Specific picture of changes in vanadium electronic structure upon discharge.},

  ABSTRACT = {The local structure of the parent and doped LaFeAsO(1-x)F(x) (pnictide) compounds were studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional methods. In the doped system, the Fe-As and Fe-Fe correlations are both well modeled by an Einstein model. For the Fe-As bonds, the Einstein temperatures are identical for the doped (11%) and undoped samples but the doped sample is found to have a lower level of static disorder. Doping is found to increases the effective Einstein temperature of Fe-Fe atomic correlation. The results suggest that the onset of superconductivity in the F doped system may be related to enhanced magnetic interactions. Density functional calculations of the total charge density reveal strong bonding between neighboring As ions but metal-like behavior in the Fe layers. It is also seen directly that the replacement of oxygen by fluorine modifies the electron charge density mainly on the Fe sites. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3525999]},

  ABSTRACT = {In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in catalysis research has traditionally been conducted by making one measurement at a time on a single sample. In an industrial research environment this is especially limiting as sample throughput (productivity) and turnaround time (direct project relevance) are critical issues in the use of XAS in a fast-moving technology delivery project. In order to address these issues we have developed and implemented a four-channel ionization chamber combined with two different in situ cells that allows XAS data to be collected simultaneously from four samples, or four regions, in transmission geometry without any sample or detector movement. In the development of this new capability it was realized that there are other benefits from this simultaneous detection in addition to increased productivity. Namely, (i) the use of EXAFS to determine the structure of a catalyst in situ axially at four different positions down a catalyst bed; (ii) the ability to collect up to four XAFS spectra simultaneously and thereby avoid any scan-to-scan uncertainties, and (iii) the added confidence in the ability to discriminate small differences in similarly prepared catalysts which is typical in the development of a commercial catalyst. Specific illustrations of each of these applications are shown. The methodology is simple to implement and could be used on any XAFS beamline with a horizontal fan of radiation, such as at a typical bending magnet or wiggler source beamline.},

  ABSTRACT = {Elucidation of complex biogeochemical processes and their effects on speciation of U in the subsurface is critical for developing remediation strategies with an understanding of stability. We have developed static microcosms that are similar to bioreduction process studies in situ under laminar flow conditions or in sediment pores. Uranium L(3)-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis with depth in the microcosms indicated that transformation of U(VI) to U(IV) occurred by at least two distinct processes. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated that initial U(VI) species associated with C- and P-containing ligands were transformed to U(IV) in the form of uraninite and U associated with Fe-bound ligands. Microbial community analysis identified putative Fe(III) and sulfate reducers at two different depths in the microcosms. The slow reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) may contribute the stability of U(IV) within microcosms at 11 months after a decrease in bioreducing conditions due to limited electron donors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ti K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was applied to determine the Ti co-ordination environment in the surface amorphised layer formed on zirconolite ceramics by 2 MeV Kr(+) irradiation, to a fluence of 5 x 10(15) ions cm(-2). The application of XAS in a grazing angle geometry was demonstrated to be essential in order to probe only the surface damaged layer (<1000 nm thick), in isolation of the undamaged interior of the specimen. 2 MeV Kr(+) irradiation induced a change in the Ti co-ordination environment from majority six fold to majority five fold in the amorphised surface layer. This finding is consistent with the formation of five fold Ti in metamict natural zirconolite, as reported previously and confirmed in this study, despite the difference in dose rate of at least 10(12) between ion beam irradiated and naturally metamict materials. This study therefore opens the door to systematic investigation of composition - structure - property relations in materials designed for radioactive waste immobilisation, through the combined application of ion beam irradiation and grazing angle XAS.
