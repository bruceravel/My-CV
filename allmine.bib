                  interchange of XAFS data. The XAFS Data Interchange
                  (XDI) standard is meant to encapsulate a single
                  spectrum of XAFS along with relevant metadata. XDI
                  is a text-based format with a simple syntax which
                  clearly delineates metadata from the data table in a
                  way that is easily interpreted both by a computer
                  and by a human. The metadata header is inspired by
                  the format of an electronic mail header,
                  representing metadata names and values as an
                  associative array. The data table is represented as
                  columns of numbers. This format can be imported as
                  is into most existing XAFS data analysis,
                  spreadsheet, or data visualization programs. Along
                  with a specification and a dictionary of metadata
                  types, we provide an application-programming
                  interface written in C and bindings for programming
                  dynamic languages.}

                  proliferation of photoelectron scattering paths that

                  having to consider each site separately. A method is
                  proposed for automating the calculation of theory

                  conservative in seawater, it exhibits a well
                  established correlation with organic carbon in
                  marine sediments. This carbon–bromine association
                  was recently attributed to covalent bonding, with
                  organobromine in sinking particulates providing a
                  putative link between sedimentary organobromine and
                  organic matter cycling in surface waters. We
                  hypothesized that phytoplankton detritus, a major
                  precursor of sedimentary organic matter, would be
                  susceptible to bromination through oxidative
                  attack. Through a series of model experiments, we
                  demonstrate incorporation of Br into algal
                  particulate detritus through peroxidative and
                  photochemical mechanisms. Peroxidative bromination
                  was enhanced by addition of exogenous
                  bromoperoxidase, but the enzyme was not required for
                  the reaction. Fenton-like reaction conditions also
                  promoted bromination, especially under solar
                  irradiation, implicating radical mechanisms in the
                  euphotic zone as another abiotic source of
                  brominated particulates. These reactions produced
                  aliphatic and aromatic forms of organobromine,
                  suggesting that lipid- and protein-rich components
                  of algal membranes provide suitable substrates for
                  bromination. Biogenic organobromines in certain
                  genera of phytoplankton also appeared in both
                  aliphatic and aromatic forms. Experimental evidence
                  and samples from oceanic midwater sediment traps
                  imply that the aromatic fraction is more stable than
                  the aliphatic. These experiments establish Br as a
                  versatile oxidant in the transformation of
                  planktonic organic matter through both enzymatic and
                  abiotic mechanisms. Organobromine may serve as a
                  marker of oxidative breakdown of marine organic
                  detritus, with the metastable component providing a
                  short-lived indicator of early-stage oxidation. By
                  altering the stability of aliphatic and aromatic
                  moieties, bromination may affect the availability of
                  organic matter to organisms, with consequences for
                  the preservation and degradation of marine organic
                  carbon. "

                  attractive candidates for use as cathode materials
                  in the next generation of lithium-based batteries
                  owing to the operation of multielectron transfer
                  processes and thermochemical stabilities conferred
                  by the incorporation of phosphate groups. In
                  particular silver vanadium phosphorus oxide,
                  Ag(2)VO(2)PO(4), shows a much desired in situ
                  conductivity enhancement upon discharge resulting in
                  inherently high power capability with minimal
                  conductive additives needed. However, the
                  amorphization of Ag(2)VO(2)PO(4) during
                  electrochemical discharge precludes the use of
                  standard diffraction tools to monitor changes in the
                  local electronic and geometric structure. Here, we
                  have utilized a combination of V K-, V L-, Ag K-,
                  and O K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure

                  LaFeAsO(1-x)F(x) (pnictide) compounds were studied
                  by x-ray absorption spectroscopy and density
                  functional methods. In the doped system, the Fe-As
                  and Fe-Fe correlations are both well modeled by an
                  Einstein model. For the Fe-As bonds, the Einstein
                  temperatures are identical for the doped (11\%) and
                  undoped samples but the doped sample is found to
                  have a lower level of static disorder. Doping is
                  found to increases the effective Einstein
                  temperature of Fe-Fe atomic correlation. The results
                  suggest that the onset of superconductivity in the F
                  doped system may be related to enhanced magnetic
                  interactions. Density functional calculations of the
                  total charge density reveal strong bonding between
                  neighboring As ions but metal-like behavior in the
                  Fe layers. It is also seen directly that the
                  replacement of oxygen by fluorine modifies the
                  electron charge density mainly on the Fe sites. (C)

  ABSTRACT =	 {In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in
                  catalysis research has traditionally been conducted
                  by making one measurement at a time on a single
                  sample. In an industrial research environment this
                  is especially limiting as sample throughput
                  (productivity) and turnaround time (direct project
                  relevance) are critical issues in the use of XAS in
                  a fast-moving technology delivery project. In order
                  to address these issues we have developed and
                  implemented a four-channel ionization chamber
                  combined with two different in situ cells that
                  allows XAS data to be collected simultaneously from
                  four samples, or four regions, in tran smission
                  geometry without any sample or detector movement. In
                  the development of this new capability it was
                  realized that there are other benefits from this
                  simultaneous detection in addition to increased
                  productivity. Namely, (i) the use of EXAFS to
                  determine the structure of a catalyst in situ
                  axially at four different positions down a catalyst
                  bed; (ii) the ability to collect up to four XAFS
                  spectra simultaneously and thereby avoid any
                  scan-to-scan uncertainties, and (iii) the added
                  confidence in the ability to discriminate small
                  differences in similarly prepared catalysts which is
                  typical in the development of a commercial
                  catalyst. Specific illustrations of each of these
                  applications are shown. The methodology is simple to
                  implement and could be used on any XAFS beamline
                  with a horizontal fan of radiation, such as at a
                  typical bending magnet or wiggler source beamline.},

                  with an understanding of stability. We have
                  developed static microcosms that are similar to
                  bioreduction process studies in situ under laminar
                  flow conditions or in sediment pores. Uranium
                  L(3)-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy
                  analysis with depth in the microcosms indicated that
                  transformation of U(VI) to U(IV) occurred by at
                  least two distinct processes. Extended X-ray
                  absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated
                  that initial U(VI) species associated with C- and
                  P-containing ligands were transformed to U(IV) in
                  the form of uraninite and U associated with Fe-bound
                  ligands. Microbial community analysis identified
                  putative Fe(III) and sulfate reducers at two
                  different depths in the microcosms. The slow
                  reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) may contribute the
                  stability of U(IV) within microcosms at 11 months
                  after a decrease in bioreducing conditions due to
                  limited electron donors.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Ti K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was
                  applied to determine the Ti co-ordination
                  environment in the surface amorphised layer formed
                  on zirconolite ceramics by 2 MeV Kr(+) irradiation,
                  to a fluence of 5 x 10(15) ions cm(-2). The
                  application of XAS in a grazing angle geometry was
                  demonstrated to be essential in order to probe only
                  the surface damaged layer (<1000 nm thick), in
                  isolation of the undamaged interior of the
                  specimen. 2 MeV Kr(+) irradiation induced a change
                  in the Ti co-ordination environment from majority
                  six fold to majority five fold in the amorphised
                  surface layer. This finding is consistent with the
                  formation of five fold Ti in metamict natural
                  zirconolite, as reported previously and confirmed in
                  this study, despite the difference in dose rate of
                  at least 10(12) between ion beam irradiated and
                  naturally metamict materials. This study therefore
                  opens the door to systematic investigation of
